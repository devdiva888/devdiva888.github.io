            <p>Hi, my name is Tia Katariina. I'm a beauty enthusiast. I love to learn, write, try new things and share my experiences when it comes to
              beauty, skincare and wellness. Let me do the dirty work and research to save you from the trouble!
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>I grew up in Finland, where I was the shy kid who felt like the "ugly one" and struggled with low self-esteem because of my appearance. During my teenage years, 
            I began experimenting with different beauty products and methods, hoping to improve how I looked and felt. These experiments taught me valuable lessons, which I’m 
            now eager to share with others.</p>
            <p>My journey with beauty experiments had its ups and downs. I dealt with severe acne and hair loss due to bleaching, but eventually, I achieved clear skin and my hair began to 
              grow back stronger. These experiences have made me more cautious. I now thoroughly research and listen to advice before trying new things, ensuring I make safer and more 
              informed decisions.</p>
          <p>Now, at 25, I still love Finland but only during its warm summers. I find the cold unbearable, so I moved to Tenerife in 2022 and lived there for a year. Since July 2023, 
            I’ve been living in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
           <p>I've lived in four different countries, and each one has taught me valuable lessons about beauty and confidence. It's been incredible and very educational to meet people 
            from all walks of life, experience different cultures firsthand, and really immerse myself in them. I'm happy to continue learning and sharing my experiences through my writing.</p>

          <p>In my newsletter, I will share all kinds of beauty and wellness tips that I find valuable and think you might too. I want to share what works for me—things that have improved my 
            routines and overall well-being. I’ll also talk about interesting discoveries that could be useful to you and warn you about the things that you might want to avoid.</p>
            <p>I aim to create an honest and reliable platform for anyone looking for new ideas to enhance their looks. Whether you’re in search of a new skincare routine, 
              ways to grow your hair healthier, or just general beauty advice, I’ll be here offering the tips and tricks that I come across.</p>
              <p>I hope you find the information in this newsletter helpful, and I’m looking forward to communicating with my readers. Let’s learn and grow in our beauty and wellness journeys together.</p>
