    <h2>Who is Tia?</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Tia. 
      My academic background is in Marketing, but my interests quickly shifted towards web development. I am highly motivated and consider myself a quick learner, 
      always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set. MY goal is to gain valuable experience as a front-end developer by actively participating in 
      diverse projects. Currently, I possess proficiency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In addition to my professional pursuits, I maintain a healthy lifestyle and enjoy activities such as running. I believe in the importance of hard work and 
      dedication in achieving one's goals. With a strong work ethic and a commitment to continuous improvement, I am ready to contribute effectively in the field 
      of web development.</p>
